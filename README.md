Vortex Robotics 14969 autonomous and teleop code for the FTC Ultimate Goal 2020-2021 season.
Teleop: Two driver controllers programmed, drivetrain and non-drivetrain. Non-drivetrain contains all non design modules not related to the wheels, as its' name suggests. Ie intake(reversed and forward movement), shooting, two servos, as well as arm and claw.
Autonomous: Several algorithms included to add precision and efficiency to our code: Angle adjustment, calculates displacement of angle using IMU sensor and adjusts until displacement is no longer greater than one degree.
